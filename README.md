# Alternating multilayer (five) twist graphene with self-consistent interlayer screening

- Requirement: slatec, intel MKL and intel fortran compiler (ifort)
- use `make` command to compile the fortran source codes into a main program, named `main`
- Usage: `./main 1.83 0` will generate a `potential.csv` data file with twist angle `1.83` degree, without external displacement field
- Use `plotband.ipynb` to generate plots
